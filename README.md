# BlogBlastApp

BlogBlastApp is a unique digital blogging platform aimed at providing users with a seamless, secure, and engaging blogging experience. It allows users to express their thoughts and ideas, share insights, and interact with a global audience.

## Description

BlogBlastApp is built using Razor SSR .NET 8, C#, and SQL Server SSMS, leveraging the Blazor Framework for the frontend. It implements CRUD functionalities to enable users to create, read, update, and delete their blog posts. Additionally, the platform includes features such as user authentication, blog post management, commenting, and basic content management.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Enables users to register, securely log in, recover forgotten passwords, and implements multi-factor authentication for enhanced security.
- **Blog Post Management:** Allows users to create original blog posts with title, content, and optional image attachments. Users can browse existing blog posts, edit/update their posts, and remove them as well.
- **Commenting:** Registered users can leave comments on blog posts, delete their own comments, and engage in threaded commenting for better interaction.
- **Performance:** The application is optimised for robust performance, capable of managing concurrent user sessions efficiently. Performance metrics such as page load times are established to ensure swift performance.

- **Usability:** The UI is responsive and intuitively designed, facilitating ease of navigation and interaction. Reasonable error messages and feedback functionality are integrated to guide users in case of incorrect inputs and system errors.
